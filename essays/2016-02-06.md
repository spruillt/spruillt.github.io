*Introduction*

## Hello! 
My name is Tyler Spruill and I am a Junior at the Shidler College of Business. I am taking MIS because a friend told me to join the Information Technology Management Association (ITMA) and I fell in love with the program. It has since opened a world of opportunities for me.
